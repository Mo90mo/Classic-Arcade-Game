## What I've done

- I created an enemy prototype with a render, update and checkcollision function
- I created a player prototype with a render, update and handleInput function
- I created different levels of difficulties by increasing the bugs speed whenever the player hits a specific score
- I created a"choose your avatar" section to give the possibility to the user to play with his/her favorite avatar 
- I created a score counter which increases each time the player reaches the water
- I created a lives counter which decreases each time one bug is hit
- I created a "record" section which takes note of the best score of the player
- I created a slide window to explain to the user how to play.
- I created a pop up window which appears at the end of the game reporting the score and asking if the player wants to play again.
